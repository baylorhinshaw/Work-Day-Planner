# Work-Day-Scheduler
In this work day scheduler I use HTML, CSS, and jQuery to make an application you can use keep track of your day.
You will notice that throughout the hours of the day if the time has passed then they turn grey, if it is the time it is red, and if it is upcoming then it is green.
